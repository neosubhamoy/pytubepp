### **üìå Commands and Flags**

** Before Starting Please NOTE: PytubePP follows a simple rule - "Use the Default Download Configuration if No Flags are Passed"
* To download a video in maximum available resolution the command will look like:
```terminal
pytubepp "https://youtube.com/watch?v=2lAe1cqCOXo"
```
* To download the video in a specific resolution (suppose 480p) the command will be:
```terminal
pytubepp "https://youtube.com/watch?v=2lAe1cqCOXo" -s 480p
```
* To download the video in audio-only MP3 format the command will be:
```terminal
pytubepp "https://youtube.com/watch?v=2lAe1cqCOXo" -s mp3
```

```terminal
pytubepp "https://youtube.com/watch?v=2lAe1cqCOXo" -i
```
